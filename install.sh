# Reproducible systemd setup for catallenya, and the GATE that enforces the job
# contract.
#
# Two jobs in one script, deliberately:
#
#   1. It installs — writes the boot orchestrator, symlinks every unit, links the
#      policy drop-ins that give each job its class and family, enables timers and
#      path units.
#   2. It VALIDATES — refuses to install anything if any job breaks its contract.
#
# The second is what stops the drift this whole layout exists to fix. install.sh is
# the only sanctioned way to put a unit on this box, and the map below drives both
# the symlink and the policy, so a job that is not registered here does not get
# installed at all rather than getting installed without policy. Loud, not silent.
#
# Validation runs over EVERYTHING before ANYTHING is linked. A contract violation
# found halfway through must not leave the box half-configured.
#
# Class and family are read from each unit's own [X-Catallenya] block rather than
# repeated in a map here. One source of truth: the unit says what it is, and this
# script only decides whether to believe it.
#
# Idempotent — safe to re-run.
