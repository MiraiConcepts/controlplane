# Everything here runs offline and free. The gate is tested by breaking a COPY of
# a REAL unit and confirming it refuses — a synthetic fixture would only prove the
# gate agrees with a fixture, while the real file is never written: it is the live
# target of an /etc/systemd/system symlink, so the old sed-in-place version put
# broken content into the running config for the duration of every case (and left
# NeedDaemonReload drift plus mktemp-mode files behind — 2026-08-13 audit). The
# watchdog is tested against the per-user systemd manager, so real systemd does
# the parsing and drop-in merging rather than a mock that agrees with whatever the
# script already believes.
#
# Nothing here touches the system manager, /etc/systemd/system, or any file a
# system unit resolves. Run before commit:
